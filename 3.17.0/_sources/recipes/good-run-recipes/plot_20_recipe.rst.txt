Calculating and plotting the divergence of sea currents
=======================================================

In this recipe, we will calculate the divergence of depth-averaged
currents in the Irish Sea, then plot the divergence as a contour
fill plot underneath the vectors themselves in the form of a vector plot.

1. Import cf-python and cf-plot:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-16

.. code-block:: python

    import cfplot as cfp

    import cf








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-23

2. Read the fields in. This dataset consists of depth-averaged eastward and
northward current components plus the sea surface height above sea level and
is a gridded dataset, with grid resolution of 1.85 km, covering the entire
Irish Sea area. It was found via the CEDA Archive at the location of:
https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/1b89e025eedd49e8976ee0721ec6e9b5, with
DOI of https://dx.doi.org/10.5285/031e7ca1-9710-280d-e063-6c86abc014a0:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-25

.. code-block:: python

    f = cf.read("~/recipes/POLCOMS_WAM_ZUV_01_16012006.nc")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

3. Get the separate vector components, which are stored as separate fields.
The first, 'u', corresponds to the eastward component and the second, 'v',
the northward component:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-32

.. code-block:: python

    u = f[0]
    v = f[1]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-34

4. Squeeze the fields to remove the size 1 axes in each case:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-37

.. code-block:: python

    u = u.squeeze()
    v = v.squeeze()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-45

5. Consider the currents at a set point in time. To do this we
select one of the 720 datetime sample points in the fields to
investigate, in this case by subspacing to pick out a particular
datetime value we saw within the time coordinate data of the field (but
you could also use indexing or filtering to select a specific value).
Once we subspace to one datetime, we squeeze out the size 1 time axis
in each case:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-51

.. code-block:: python

    chosen_time = "2006-01-15 23:30:00"  # 720 choices to pick from, try this one!
    u_1 = u.subspace(T=cf.dt(chosen_time))
    v_1 = v.subspace(T=cf.dt(chosen_time))
    u_1 = u_1.squeeze()
    v_1 = v_1.squeeze()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-59

6.
When inspecting the u and v fields using cf inspection methods such as
from print(u_1.data) and u_1.data.dump(), for example, we can see that there are
lots of -9999 values in their data array, apparently used as a
fill/placeholder value, including to indicate undefined data over the land.
In order for these to not skew the data and dominate the plot, we need
to mask values matching this, so that only meaningful values remain.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-62

.. code-block:: python

    u_2 = u_1.where(cf.lt(-9000), cf.masked)
    v_2 = v_1.where(cf.lt(-9000), cf.masked)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-68

7. Calculate the divergence using the 'div_xy' function operating on the
vector eastward and northward components as the first and second argument
respectively. We need to calculate this for the latitude-longitude plane
of the Earth, defined in spherical polar coordinates, so we must specify
the Earth's radius for the appropriate calculation:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-70

.. code-block:: python

    div = cf.div_xy(u_2, v_2, radius="earth")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-76

8. First we configure the overall plot by
making the map higher resolution, to show the coastlines of the UK and
Ireland in greater detail, and changing the colourmap to better reflect
the data which can be positive or negative, i.e. has 0 as the 'middle'
value of significance, so should use a diverging colour map.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-79

.. code-block:: python

    cfp.mapset(resolution="10m")
    cfp.cscale("ncl_default", ncols=21)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-87

9. Now generate the final plot. Plot the current vectors, noting we had
to play around with the 'stride' and 'scale' parameter values to adjust
the vector spacing and size so that the vector field is best represented
and visible without over-cluttering the plot. Finally we plot the
divergence as a contour plot without any lines showing. This compound
plot is saved on one canvas using 'gopen' and 'gclose' to wrap the two
plotting calls:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-98

.. code-block:: python

    cfp.gopen()
    cfp.vect(u=u_2, v=v_2, stride=6, scale=3, key_length=1)
    cfp.con(
        div,
        lines=False,
        title=(
            f"Depth-averaged Irish Sea currents at {chosen_time} with "
            "their divergence"
        ),
    )
    cfp.gclose()
