**Introduction**
================

----

Version |release| for version |version| of the CF conventions.

The Python cf package is an Earth science data analysis library that
is built on a complete implementation of the :ref:`CF-data-model`.



**Functionality**
-----------------
----

.. note:: **This version of cf is for Python 3 only** and there are
          :ref:`incompatible differences between versions 2.x and 3.x
          <two-to-three-changes>` of cf.

	  Scripts written for version 2.x but running under version
          3.x should either work as expected, or provide informative
          error messages on the new API usage. However, it is advised
          that the outputs of older scripts be checked when running
          with Python 3 versions of the cf library.

	  For version 2.x documentation, see the :ref:`older releases
	  <Older-releases>` page.

The cf package implements the :ref:`CF-data-model` [#cfdm]_ for its
internal data structures and so is able to process any CF-compliant
dataset. It is not strict about CF-compliance, however, so that
partially conformant datasets may be ingested from existing datasets
and written to new datasets.This is so that datasets which are
partially conformant may nonetheless be modified in memory.

   ----------------------------------
   Data            : air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K
   Cell methods    : time(12): mean (interval: 1.0 month)
   Dimension coords: time(12) = [0450-11-16 00:00:00, ..., 0451-10-16 12:00:00] noleap
                   : latitude(64) = [-87.8638, ..., 87.8638] degrees_north
                   : longitude(128) = [0.0, ..., 357.1875] degrees_east
                   : height(1) = [2.0] m

The cf package can:

* read field constructs from netCDF, PP and UM datasets,

* create new field constructs in memory,

* inspect field constructs,

* test whether two field constructs are the same,

* modify field construct metadata and data,

* create subspaces of field constructs,

* write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,

* incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files,

* read, write, and create data that have been compressed by
  convention (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays), whilst presenting a
  view of the data in its uncompressed form,

* combine field constructs arithmetically,

* manipulate field construct data by arithmetical and trigonometrical
  operations,

* perform statistical collapses on field constructs,

* perform histogram, percentile and binning operations on field
  constructs,
  
* regrid field constructs,

* apply convolution filters to field constructs,

* calculate derivatives of field constructs,

* create field constructs to create derived quantities (such as vorticity).

**Visualization**
-----------------

----

Powerful, flexible, and very simple to produce visualizations of field
constructs are available with the `cf-plot package
<http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot>`_, that needs to be installed
separately to cf.

See the `cf-plot gallery
<http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/gallery.html>`_ for the wide range
range plotting possibilities with example code.
